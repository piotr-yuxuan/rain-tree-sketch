武満徹の雨の樹素描

> One of the most influential Japanese composers in the late twentieth century, Toru Takemitsu (1930-96) created a unique musical language by integrating the disparate musical traditions of East and West. This lecture/recital will investigate the metaphor behind Takemitsu's last two solo piano pieces, Rain Tree Sketch (1982) and Rain Tree Sketch II (1992). The lecture explores the interaction of ideas between Takemitsu and his novelist friend Kenzaburo Oe, the Nobel Prize winning author whom inspired Takemitsu to compose the Rain Tree series. An analytic overview of the piano pieces will also be given which indicates the influence of Olivier Messiaen. A performance of the complete Rain Tree Sketcheswill follow the lecture.

> The origin of the Rain Tree Sketches can be traced back to Takemitsu's percussion trio Rain Tree (1981), which was based on a description of a rain-tree in Kenzaburo Oe's short novel "Clever Rain Tree" (1980). Rain Tree is used as a metaphor of water circulating in the cosmos, and Takemitsu employed Messiaen's modes of limited transposition in order to construct the pitch collections evocative of cosmic imagery. Takemitsu's goal as an artist was to expand the possibilities of music, and to express himself through creation of a universal language. This lecture/recital will demonstrate how this goal is realized in the Rain Tree Sketches.
